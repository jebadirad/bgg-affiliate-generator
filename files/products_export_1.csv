steven-rhodes-dont-talk-to-strangers,Steven Rhodes: Don't Talk to Strangers,"<p><span>From the mind of Steven Rhodes, a graphic artist, and illustrator best known for his offbeat reimagining of children’s activity books from the ’70s and ’80s. <em>Don’t Talk to Strangers</em><strong> </strong>immerses you in these hilariously dark retro worlds and is one of three stand-alone games in Vol. 1 of Steven Rhodes Games. </span></p>
<p><span>Don't Talk to Strangers starts when school lets out for the day--mom and dad haven't noticed yet, but STRANGERS are popping up everywhere--and these STRANGERS are really strange--""from another planet"" strange! Each turn you'll play a new movement card in order to navigate your kids - one at a time - from the starting school space, across the board to a ""scoring space"", that's both safe from aliens and a fun way to waste the afternoon!</span></p>
<p><span>School's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here! Mom and Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space. Score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!</span></p>
<p><span>Game Play:</span></p>
<p>1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each kid you have in the Library).</p>
<p>2. Remember: You want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!</p>
<p>3. But watch out! When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a ""STRANGER SPACE!"" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may have to reroute your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid<span>—</span><span>even one who has already scored</span><span>—</span><span>but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the FLYING SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!</span></p>

sleeping-gods,Sleeping Gods,"<p class=""acd-style"">             
                    		In Sleeping Gods, you and up to 3 friends become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the Manticore. You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.<br>
<br>
Sleeping Gods is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.<br>
<br>
Sleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.<br>
<br>
Sleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home!<br>
<br>
Welcome to a vast world. Your journey starts now.<br>

ark-nova,Ark Nova,"<p class=""acd-style"">             
                    		In Ark Nova, you will plan and design a modern, scientifically managed zoo. With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment, you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects all over the world. Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving this goal.<br>
<br>
At the heart of Ark Nova are 255 cards featuring animals, specialists, unique enclosures, and conservation projects, each with a particular ability. Use them to increase the appeal and scientific reputation of your zoo and to collect conservation points. Each player has a set of action cards, which you will use and upgrade to carry out your plans.<br>
<br>
Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay, and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies. The cards are:<br>
- BUILD: Allows you to build standard or special enclosures, kiosks, and pavilions.<br>
- ANIMALS: Allows you to accommodate animals in your zoo.<br>
- CARDS: Allows you to gain new zoo cards (animals, sponsors, and conservation project cards).<br>
- ASSOCIATION: Allows your association workers to carry out different tasks.<br>
- SPONSORS: Allows you to play a sponsor card in your zoo or to raise money.<br>
<br>
With a lot of love for the theme, game designer Mathias Wigge has created an interestingly interwoven game. With high replayability and rich components, Ark Nova provides a remarkable gaming experience that will bring the game to the table again and again.<br>

caldera-park,Caldera Park,"<p class=""acd-style"">             
                    		Welcome to the wilderness of North America! Breathtaking mountain views and spectacular geysers await you. Vast forests and prairie provide habitats for native animals. Your task is to group animals of the same species together in families as large as possible. But large families are only half the battle: to score a lot of points, they also need access to watering holes and must avoid bad weather.<br>
<br>
A turn comprises two simple steps: First, one player chooses a feature (species or watering hole) and a terrain requirement from a limited selection. Then, each player must place one of their tokens showing that feature onto one of their park spaces obeying that terrain requirement. What seems no trouble at first grows more and more challenging and exciting as the available spaces become fewer and fewer. But it’s not only the choices of your fellow players that can disrupt your plans. There are also unpredictable weather tokens that you must take into account.<br>
<br>
After five rounds, the game ends. Then you score your most valuable family of each species and the terrains you completely populated.<br>
<br>
Caldera Park is an interactive puzzle-game that achieves a perfect balance between strategic planning and luck. This, and its accessible ruleset, make it a great next step for anyone who enjoyed Savannah Park.<br>

cheating-moth,Cheating Moth,"<p class=""acd-style"">Cheating is forbidden? Not in this naughty game of cards – in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.<br> <br> In Cheating Moth you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug – which stays on the table throughout the game – and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.<br> <br> On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.<br> <br> There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug – and only him! – can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.<br> <br> Cheating is a necessity as the ""Cheating Moth"" cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)<br> <br> The action cards work as follows:<br> Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.<br> Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.<br> Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.<br> Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.<br> When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.</p>",DEVIR GAMES,Toys & Games > Games > Board Games,Board Game,"boardgame, card games, dexterity games, party games",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,DVACHEATINGMOTH,226.796185,shopify,1,deny,manual,14.99,19.99,true,true,8436589627109,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0749/3337/1164/files/dvacheatingmoth_web_box_3d_l.jpg?v=1686603454,1,,false,"Cheating moth, a game where cheating is encouraged",Cheating moth card board game where cheating is encouraged,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,6.59,true,,,true,,,active

                      Pachamama (Mother Earth) guides the Quechua people in their search for fertile lands. This Andean goddess brings prosperity to the families of those who profoundly worship her, and Pachamama paints the landscape with the fruits of their numerous crops.<br>
<br>
Lead your people to uncharted territories in search of new lands to farm. You seek to explore these regions, to trace their contours, and to develop agriculture there according to the customs and legends of Pachamama. If you honor her by respecting her core principles of diversity and separation, Nature will reward you. If not, you will suffer her ire. Deduction and a good sense of “timing” should help you succeed…<br>

<br>
When a new land full of resources is discovered, the air in the village is full of competition: the new architects will have four days to build the most functional buildings in the new city!<br>
<br>
In each round, give strategic orders to your workers:<br>
either send them build new architectures, or make them harvest new resources (such as wheal, fish, wood or rock), which you will need for your constructions… but also to feed your workers after each day, if you want to avoid a serious penalty!<br>
<br>
But be careful: if your workers need resources on areas owned by opponents on the board, you will have to pay them too! <br>
<br>
To reach your goals, it will be crucial to decide which placement is the best for each worker and each building, to make the best out of the natural resources provided by the various areas.<br>

ruins-of-mars,Ruins of Mars,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The year is 2179, and Earth's future seems bleak. Years of pollution have tarnished the landscape, and the world's supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies, and other energy-saving solutions have slowed the problem, but the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope, yet a group of optimistic explorers are trekking to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In search of knowledge, these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing the rapid deterioration of Earth. They'll need to replicate Martian technologies, translate their languages, and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save Earth as they know it.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">In<span data-mce-fragment=""1""> </span><em data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Ruins of Mars</strong></em>, players compete to build out their arsenal of knowledge, attempting to understand the languages of ancient civilizations that colonized Mars and made it a hub of economic activity. The game is played around a board with five locations and eleven communal action tiles that are laid out at random underneath the board as evenly as possible.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">On a turn, you choose one of the locations, optionally pay to shift an action tile from an adjacent location to the active one, take the action of the location — the effect of which will be based on the tiles below that space — optionally replicate alien tech by paying resources and adding it to your board for personal use, then reallocate the action tiles from the active site in a mancala-like fashion.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Over the course of the game, you learn the Martian languages and re-discover and study their technologies, which come in three levels and multiple classifications and which grant you special abilities. Along the way, you might pick up radiation from various actions, and you'll want to ditch that if possible so as not to lose points in the final scoring, which is mostly based on the tech you've assembled and your skill with languages.</p>",Atheris Games,Toys & Games > Games > Board Games,Board Game,"2-player games, boardgame, economic games, solo mode games, strategy",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,ATH2020,1179.340162,shopify,1,deny,manual,26.24,34.99,true,true,865145000243,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0749/3337/1164/files/pic4034784.webp?v=1686344241,1,,false,,Ruins of mars board game,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,8.00,true,,,true,,,active

Welcome to the Northern Expanse, a place where nature is still unexplored, mystical and dangerous. When the humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, filled with bountiful forests, lakes swimming with fish and cold freshwater flowing from the mountains. But as their settlements expanded and the surrounding forests grew thinner, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, and with their fangs, claws and mystical powers, they proved an incredible threat to the humans. In order to protect the settlements, humans enlisted specialised hunters, tasked with tracking and killing the Beasts before too many of their kin perish.<br> <br> The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its track from the hunters. However, whenever a hunter moves over a location where the Beast has previously been, a trail appears. Only when a hunter searches a location or the Beast itself attacks an unsuspecting target is the Beast's actual position revealed. More so, each hunter has but one chance of searching each round, making it a tense and difficult decision. Hunters seldom have full information whether the trail they’re pursuing contains the Beast’s actual location, or if the trail has already gone cold.<br> <br> Each action you perform in this game is done by playing a card from your hand (up to a maximum of two cards per turn). This means that if a player wants to search, attack or move, they need to have a card in their hand that lets them do that. Before each round, both hunters and Beast participate in a draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both Beast and hunters alike.<br> <br> In order to win this game, you either need to cooperate every step of the way if you play as a hunter, or skillfully outmaneuver your opponents if you play as Beast. On their own, hunters are never stronger than the Beast. Only when hunters communicate, strategize and combine their actions can they bring down the Beast before it’s too late.<br> <br><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Players</strong>: 2-4</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Ages</strong>: 14 and up</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Time</strong>: 60-120 MInutes </span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Mechanic</strong>: Action Drafting, Hand Management </span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Complexity</strong>: Medium </span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Contents</strong><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">:</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">character mats - 6 beasts and 6 hunters</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">12 character standees</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">15 summons</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">1 double-sided maps</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">2 Double-sided contracts </span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">1 minimap, screen, and location token</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">16 action cards </span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">18 hunter ability cards </span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">24 beast ability cards</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">48 beast movement cards</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">25 item cards</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">25 beastly talent cards</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">18 grudges (six 3's and twelve 1s)</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">27 habitat tokens</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">18 upgrade tokens</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">30 trail tokens</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">6 watchtower tokens</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">7 settlers (farmers)</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">7 settlers (nobles)</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">28 sheep </span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">19 boars</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">4 bears</span><br><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">12 wound tokens (six 3's and twelve 1s)</span>",PEGASUS SPIELE,Toys & Games > Games > Board Games,Board Game,"2-player games, boardgame, recommended, strategy",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,PES56420E,2676.194983,shopify,3,deny,manual,48.74,64.99,true,true,4250231734755,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0749/3337/1164/files/pes56420e_web_box_3d_l.jpg?v=1686505668,1,,false,Beast board game one vs many,Hunt the beast in this 1 vs many game,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,37.04,true,,,true,,,active

In this cooperative family role-playing game, each player chooses one of four powerful heroes: the magician, the warrior, the archer, or the dwarf. Your heroic journey begins with a mission to rescue some wolf cubs that are lost in a dangerous mine. But, before embarking on your search, your party must get past Mart, the bridge guard, by completing all of his tasks. Only then will he let your party cross his bridge and enter the mine. However, danger still lurks on the horizon, as a dragon encroaches on the castle Rietburg just as you approach the mine.

3-seeds-reap-where-you-sow,3 Seeds: Reap Where you sow,"<p class=""acd-style"">A Deceptively Simple, Highly Approachable, Light Strategy Card Came <br> <br> Looking for a game your friends and family can learn in 3 minutes but that creates rewarding decisions for players of all skill levels? 3 Seeds is what you have been looking for! Will you play your money, time, and labor seeds on crops to reap short term harvests bonuses, use your special event cards to collect long term crop set bonuses, or manipulate the secret harvest bonuses to do a little or both? Remember, its not just what you sow, but where you sow that matters!</p>
<p>Gameplay:<br>Each player is given a deck of 6 Seed cards consisting of 2 time, 2 money, and 2 labor cards. During your turn, you will draw the top 3 Seed cards from your deck. You will try gain insight into one of the return/harvest values assigned to the crops in play. With that information and the seeds you have in-hand, you will play 2 of the 3 seeds in your hand on any of the crops in play. Special earned event cards may also be played during your turn to further your success.</p>
<p>The seeds you play on crops will be returned to you once the crop receives enough seeds on it to be completed/harvested. Once a crop is completed, players will receive points equal to the crop's harvest number multiplied by the number of seeds they played on that crop. Once a crop is complete, a new Harvest and Crop card is drawn.</p>
<p>The game ends when the crop is completed and there are no more Crop cards in the deck. The player with the most points at the end wins.</p>

steven-rhodes-lets-summon-demons,Steven Rhodes: Let's Summon Demons,"<p class=""acd-style"">Welcome to Let's Summon Demons!, the perfect blend of card-based strategy and exciting dice rolling! Based off of one of the most popular pieces in Steven Rhodes' beloved Sinister 70's collection, this delightfully dark but tongue-in-cheek ""light strategy"" game has you assembling a unique team of lovable boys, girls, and animals from ""the block""...in order to summon demons! This game is the second stand-alone game in of the first volume of three Steven Rhodes Games. </p>
<p class=""acd-style""><span>What are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know: Let's Summon Demons! Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the ""rotten"" kids or sharing the love with the ""sweet"" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player</span><span>—</span><span>the best Demon Summoner</span><span>—</span><span>will walk away a winner!</span></p>
<p class=""acd-style""><span>How to play:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1.<span> </span><span>Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available to all players for purchase (for the low price of 3 Soul Tokens). This is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combine together!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice. If any player's cards they've acquired match the total rolled, then that card activates, often resulting in the acquisition of more Soul Tokens! More Soul Tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, which means even more Soul Tokens. But to what end?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>4. Well, you can sacrifice</span><span>—</span><span>err, discard</span><span>—</span><span>3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons</span><span>—and </span><span>has a balance of 10 Souls on top of that</span><span>—</span><span>they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!</span>

The rules of the game are (mostly) the same, but there are some changes between the two editions: <br>
No Expansions: The tiles size of the Travel Edition is smaller than the regular game, so it is not possible to add any expansion for the regular game. EXCEPT The Phantom expansion.<br>
